##### By: Steph Karlsen

# Skill Distillery - Week 7: Film Query

This is an application that searches a database of movies by either a keyword or a title id of the movie. The list generated will give the user the name, release date, rating, description and cast or a particular movie or a list of movies. 


# Technologies used

MySQL - SQL - Maven - Java - Eclipse - Git - GitHub

# Concepts Used

Database extraction with Prepared Statements - Object Oriented Programming - Class hierarchies - Interfaces - APIE (Abstraction - Polymorphism - Inheritance - Encapsulation) - Implementation - Lists - Collections - Try/Catch Statements and Exceptions 


# Lessons Learned

This project was an introduction to mySQL, SQL and Maven. I see now how the SQL database search commands from the terminal can be used in Java programming to bring items from databases into your program. 

I learned about the differences between a statement and a prepared statement and the importance of using a prepared statement to safe guard your data. 



Each project seems to cement my understanding of OOP, inheritance and collections just a bit more.
